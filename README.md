Your safety in the laboratory is very important: 
• At all times wear a lab coat, suitable shoes with enclosed heel and toe and safety glasses. 
• Always work to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you. 
• Immediately report any injuries or spills to a demonstrator. 
• Microorganisms will be used in this class, avoid touching things to your mouth and wash hands carefully after the class. 
A risk assessment has been carried out for the practical classes and identified risks minimised. 
ACTIVITY 1: AN AUTOSOMAL GENE IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA  50 MINS 
Arabidopsis thaliana is a commonly   used   model organism   in genetics.   In this   section, you   will   investigate the   inheritance of a gene   involved   in   producing the trichomes on the   leaves   of A. thaliana. Wildtype   plants   produce trichomes on their   leaves,   but   mutant   plants do   not   produce these trichomes   (Fig.   1). This   mutant   phenotype   is   known as glabrous, which   means smooth.  
Fig.   1 Wildtype   (left) and glabrous (smooth)   mutant (right) A. thaliana plants
Q1.1a. What characteristics would   make an organism   like A. thaliana a   useful   model   organism   in   genetics?
We crossed pure-breeding (homozygous) wildtype   plants with pure-breeding smooth   (glabrous)   mutants   to   obtain   first-filial   generation   (F1   ) offspring.
Q1.1b. Without   looking   at   the   offspring   phenotypes, what   can   we   already   deduce   about   the   genotype   of the   F1    plants, given the way the cross   was   set   up?
Familiarise   yourself   with   the   parental   phenotypes   and   observe   the   phenotype   of   the   F1.
Q1.1c. What   is the   phenotype of the   F1    plants?
Q1.1d. What does this observation   indicate about the   inheritance   pattern   of the   mutant?
The   F1    progeny were allowed to self-fertilise to   produce second-filial   generation   (F2   )   offspring.   Working   as a   pair, observe the   F2   sample you   have   been allocated.
Q1.1e. Score your group sample of   F2      plants   and   record the   data   in Table   1   below.

Q1.1f. Using   the   standard   allelic   notation   for   this   gene, Gl for   the   wildtype   allele   and gl for   the   smooth allele,   propose a genetic   hypothesis to account for these observations   by   filling   in   the   gaps   below.

Q1.1g. The expected   F2 genotypic ratio   is   …
The expected   F2 phenotypic ratio   is   …
Practical Task 1.2: Forming and testing a genetic hypothesis using F2 data 
A   genetic   hypothesis   is   a   statement   explaining   what   you   think   is   happening   at   the   genetic   level.   You   should include   the   following   information   in   the   genetic   hypothesis:
•         The   number of gene   loci   involved.
•          How   many alleles are at each   gene   locus   and   the   names   of the   alleles.
•         The   inheritance   pattern of the   mutant   phenotype   (dominant or   recessive, autosomal or   sex- linked).
•       The   expected   phenotypic   ratio   for   the   cross   (in   this   case,   the   F2    generation).
Q1.2a. Write   a   genetic   hypothesis   for   the   F2   generation   by   completing   the   following.
There   is/are   gene   locus/loci   being considered   in this cross with   allele/s. The dominant phenotype   is    . The   F2   of   this   cross will   produce a   phenotypic ratio   of    .
After   writing   our   genetic   hypothesis, we   need   to   determine   if   the   results   obtained   from   experimental observations support our   hypothesis. We are   unlikely to   obtain   results   identical to   what we   predict,   so   we need to determine whether the difference   between our   observed   results   and   expected   results   is   due to sampling error or an error   in   our   hypothesis. The   more   likely   we think   it   is   due   to   an   error   in   our   hypothesis, the   more   likely we will   reject the   hypothesis and come   up with   a   new   one. 
A   basic   method of comparing observed and expected   ratios   is   the   c2      (chi-squared)   test.   Follow   the   template   below   to   complete   the   test.
Q1.2b. State   the   null   hypothesis   (refer to Appendix “Procedures for Genetic Analysis” for full statement):
Q1.2c. Calculate the chi-square   (c2   ) value for the combined   class   data   by   completing Table   2   below.   Give   all   the   decimal   answers   to 4 decimal places.

Practical Task 1.3: Modelling meiosis in the Arabidopsis cross 
The glabrous gene   is   located on Chromosome 3   in A. thaliana.   On the   diagram   below, track   Chromosome   3   through   meiosis   in the two   parents   leading   up to the   F1.   Label an arbitrary   position on   each   chromosome where the gene   is   located, and clearly indicate which allele is present on each chromosome.   Hint:   using   different   colours   will   make   this   clearer. 
In the   parents, you should draw the chromosomes   as they   would   be after DNA   replication.   But   in   the   F1,   draw   the   chromosomes   as   they   would   be   just   after   fertilisation.
ACTIVITY 2: VISUALISING CHROMOSOMES, Part 2  20 MINS 
Meiosis   occurs   in   specialised   organs   called   gonads. The   cells   within   these   organs   that   are   destined   to undergo   meiosis are called the germline cells.   In this   activity,   we   will   explore   both   meiotic   divisions   in   cells   from the   lily anther during   pollen   production. We will also   observe   the   first   meiotic   division   in   cells   from the   testis   of   a   grasshopper   species.Meiosis   consists   of   two   successive   divisions   which   serves   to   halve   the   chromosome   number.   But   the   two divisions of   meiosis differ.   In the first division, three   special   events   occur that   are   not   seen   in   the   second      meiotic division   (or   in   mitosis). These are that the:
•          homologous chromosomes   pair   up as   bivalents,
•          homologous   chromosomes   physically   swap   parts   of   their   chromatids,   and
•          homologous   chromosomes   separate   from   each   other   (while   the   sister   chromatids   stay   together).
On the other   hand, the steps that occur   in the   second   meiotic   division   are   analogous to   those   in   mitosis.
Practical Task 2.1: Meiosis in the Lily anther 
We can examine the stages of   both   meiotic   divisions   in   slides   prepared from   lily   anther   cross   sections, which   have then   been digitised   using the   Roslin   platform. These slides   reveal the developmental   stages   of pollen from early   prophase of   meiosis   I, through to the   pollen tetrads which   are   the   final   product   of   meiosis.
Using   the   computer   stations   set   up   for   you, observe   the   digitised   high-resolution   slides   from   Lily   anthers.
Q2.1a. In the   images from the   1st    meiotic division and the   image from   the   2nd      meiotic   division,   identify   as   many of the different stages as you   can.   How   many   can   you   find?   Are   there   some   that   have   not   been captured   in these   particular   images? You   may want to take   phots or draw the   best   examples.
Q2.1b. Given that this species   has   24 chromosomes   (2n =   24),   state   how   many   chromosomes   you   would   expect to find   in a cell that was   in   each   of the following   stages:
(i)                            Prophase of   mitosis
(ii)                         Metaphase   I of   meiosis
(iii)                      Prophase   II of   meiosis
(iv)                     Telophase   II of   meiosis
Practical Task 2.2: Meiosis in the grasshopper testis 
In   male grasshoppers,   meiotic chromosomes are   relatively easy to   observe.   In   somatic   cells   of the   plague      locust, Locusta migratoria, there are   24 chromosomes   in the   female   and   23   in   the   male.   Each   sex   has   11 pairs of autosomes,   but the females   have two X chromosomes   whereas the   males   have   only   one.   There   is   no Y chromosome. Thus, sex   is determined   by the   number of   X   chromosomes   present,   XX   animals   are female, and   XO   animals   are   male.
Observe the   high-resolution digitised slides of   meiosis   in grasshopper testis   using   Roslin   on the   provided computers.
Q2.2a. How   many   bivalents would   be   present during   prophase of   meiosis   I?
Q2.2b. Sister chromatids are   held together at the   centromere.   Can   you   identify   the   centromere   in   any   of   these   chromosomes?
Q2.2c. How   many sperm are   produced from each   parental diploid   cell?   How   many   chromosomes   are   present   in each sperm   produced?
ACTIVITY 3: AUXOTROPHS  30 MINS 
Your average wildtype   bacterium can   produce all the   organic   compounds   it   requires, such   as   amino   acids and vitamins, from   inorganic sources   in the environment. This type of   bacterium   is   known   as   a prototroph.   Prototrophs can grow on   minimal   media agar, which   only   contains   inorganic   ingredients. 
However,   if there   is a   block   in a   pathway to   manufacture one of   these   compounds,   the   bacteria   must   be   provided with the compound   in the environment and   will   not   grow   on   minimal   media   without   it. This strain of   bacterium   is   known as an auxotroph.   By   adding   different   compounds to   minimal   media   and   seeing   which   compound   allows   bacteria   to   grow, we   can   establish   in   which   pathway   this   block   occurs.
In   this   activity, you   will   determine   the   requirements   of   4   strains   of E. coli auxotrophs.
In the   last   practical, you set   up the   bacterial   plates for this experiment.   Remember that   each   strain   has been spread on   minimal   media. Then,   paper tabs, each   infused with   a   different   amino   acid, were   placed   on   the   plate   in the arrangement shown   in   Fig.2   below. The amino acids   in   the   paper   tabs   diffused   out   into   the      agar. These   plates were   incubated and   have   been   returned to you to   be checked for   growth. 
Fig.   2:   Positions of   paper tabs impregnated with   amino acids on   each   petri   dish 
Q3.1a. Without   using   the   word ‘control’, explain   why   one   paper   tab   is   infused   with   water   only.
Q3.1b. Had there   been growth of E. coli around the   paper   tab   infused   with   water,   how   would   this   influence   the   conclusions   you   could   draw   from   your   experiment?
Q3.2a. Record these   results   in Table 3   below,   indicating whether growth occurred   around   each   paper tab   with a + symbol,   or   using – for   no   growth.

                                                                       Strain A                       Strain B                       Strain C                    Strain D 
Arginine 
Leucine 
Methionine 
Tyrosine

Water 
Q3.2b. Which amino acid   pathway was disrupted   in   each   of the   mutant   strains?
Strain   A 
Strain   B
Strain   C
Strain   D
Q3.2c. What was   unusual about Strain   D?   How can you   explain this   result?
