PRACTICAL   INFORMATION AND APPENDICES
Welcome   to   the   Biology   Laboratory! This   first   page   contains   important   information   that   will   help   you   during your   practical classes, so you   may wish to   read through   it   carefully   so that you   are   familiar   with   how   the   practicals   run.
LOCATION, ATTENDANCE etc.
Both   practical sessions across all 4 weeks are   held in   Level 2   (Rm   210)   of the   Redmond   Barry   Building.   Please   ensure   that   you   attend   your   registered   class   as   per   your   timetable.   Attendance   will   be   taken   at   each   class.
Please   be   punctual   (or even early) and come with   the   appropriate   safety   equipment/PPE.If you are more than   15 minutes late you would have   missed the safety information   and   start   of the   practical   activities so will   NOT   be allowed to enter the   practical.   If this   happens and   you   have   a   valid   reason   for   being   late   or   absent, you   should   email   subject   staff   for   further   information.
ASSESSMENTIn   this   subject,   there   are   3   assessed   practical   classes   (Week   1   practical   is   not   assessed   but   serves   as   great   practice).   Each   practical   assessment   is   worth   7.5%   of the   overall   subject   mark.   Passing the   practicals   is the   first   hurdle   requirement   for   this   subject:   a   mark   of   at   least   50%   in   the   combined   in-semester   assessments   (Weeks 4, 5, 7   pracs   run   by   BioSciences, and a   workshop   assignment   run   by   SAFES).
Each   practical assessment consists of two   parts: a   pre-prac   quiz   based   on the   preparation   material   and   your   prior   knowledge   (worth   1.5%), and a   post-prac test which draws   on   all the   completed   practical   activities   (worth 6%). You   may   use your   notes during the assessment   (i.e., these   are   open-book   assessments),   but   you   must   complete   this   on   your   own.
BEFORE   EACH   PRAC
•          Download   and   read the   prac   notes thoroughly.   Pracs   can   be   quite   busy,   and you will   struggle   if   you   are   not   prepared.
•         Watch   the    TechTip   videos   as instructed   on   the preparation page   for   each Practical.    Information   covered   in   these   videos   will   not   be   repeated   in   class,   as   it   is   assumed   that   you   have   completed   all   preparation   and   therefore   have   knowledge   of   these   techniques   already.
•         Complete   any   other   activities   listed   on   the   Practical   Preparation   page.
•         Complete   the   pre-prac   test   before   your   scheduled   prac   day   (except   for   Week   3).
PRACTICAL   1: Chromosomes, Cell   Replication   and   DNA

Your safety in the   laboratory is   very   important:
•         At   all   times   wear   a   lab   coat, suitable   shoes   with   enclosed   heel   and   toe   and   safety   glasses.
•         Always   work   to   ensure   your   safety   and   the   safety   of   those   around   you.
•          Immediately   report   any   injuries   or   spills   to   a   demonstrator.
•          Microorganisms will   be   used   in this class, avoid touching things to your   mouth   and   wash   hands carefully   after   the   class.
A risk assessment has been carried out   for the practical   classes   and   identified   risks   minimised.


ACTIVITY   1:   USING   A   MICROSCOPE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  10   MINS
Practical Task   1.1:   Familiarise yourself with the   use of a   microscopeThe   light   microscopes   in   this   lab   can   magnify   images   up   to   400x. This   is   large   enough   to   view   most   cells   in   good   detail.   During   your   practicals,   you   will   use   2   different   microscopes   –   a   compound   microscope   and   a   dissecting   microscope.
(A)             Read Appendix   1   (pp.   11-12) and familiarise yourself with   the   compound   microscope.   
(B)             Read Appendix 2   (pp.   13)   and   familiarise   yourself   with   the   dissecting   microscope.
(C)             Read Appendix   3   (pp.   14)   and   learn   how to   estimate   size   with   both   microscope   types.
Prior to attending   Practical   1If you   did   not   complete AGRI10050   last   semester   (or   would   like   to   revise),   you   will   need   to   watch   the   two   videos   below   BEFORE   attending   the first   practical   class.   It   will   be   assumed   that   you   have   completed   this   preparation or are already   familiar with the   basic   features   of   microscopes   and how   to   use   them.
(A)             On Canvas, watch the short video   about   how   to   set   up   the   compound   microscope.
(B)             On Canvas, watch the   short video   about   how   to   set   up   the   dissecting   microscope.
During   Practical   1
We will only   be   using the compound   microscope for today’s   practical activities.   Spend   a   few   minutes   looking at the compound   microscope on your   bench.   Practice adjusting   the   magnification   and   focus   using   the   provided   newsprint.
Q1.1a. Take   note of the   information   in the appendices about   microscopes – what   are   some   of the   main   components/features   of   these   microscopes?
Q1.1b.   Recognise that the two different types of   microscope are   used   to   examine   different   samples   in   different contexts – why   might this   be   important?




ACTIVITY   2: VISUALISING   CHROMOSOMES,   Part   1                                                                                                                                                                               30   MINS
Practical Task 2.1: Garlic   Root Tip Staining
DNA   is so   long that when   it   is condensed, the   resulting chromosomes   are   large   enough to   be   viewed   quite      easily   under a   light   microscope. To see this, you   need to view cells   that   are   actively   dividing,   since   it   is   only   during cell   replication that chromatin   (DNA and   its associated   proteins)   will   condense   into   chromosomes. Most of our   mature, specialised cells do   not   actively   divide;   those   that   do   divide   are   often   unspecialised cells called stem cells. These are found   in   certain   locations   in   the   body.   For   example,   although   our   skin constantly   replenishes   itself as the outer   layers die, the adult   skin   cells   do   not   replicate;   it   is   a   layer   of   stem   cells   under the adult skin cells that constantly   produce   new   skin   cells   for   the   body.
In   plants, there are also   regions where cell   replication facilitates   plant   growth. These   regions   are   called   meristems.   For this activity, we   use garlic   root tips which   have a   meristematic   region   near   the   tip.   We   have   stained   these   cells   with   an   appropriate   stain   that   binds   to   chromatin   and   squashed   them   onto   a   glass   slide    in order to view a single   layer of   cells.   You   may   want   to   watch   the   short   TechTip   video   (Staining   a   Garlic   Root   Tip) to see   how this was   performed.
Place one of the   prepared slides onto the   stage   of the   compound   microscope.   Look   around   the   preparation   at scanning   power   (x4)   until you see small squarish   cells. These   small,   cuboidal   shaped   cells form   chains because they were   recently dividing. As cells   leave the   meristematic   region, they   start to   grow   in   size   rather than divide.   Hence, any   regions with   larger or   longer   cells   are   unlikely to   be   actively   dividing –   ignore these   regions and only zoom   in on   areas   with   cuboidal   cells.   Using   low   power   (x10),   look   for   a   cell   in   which   the   chromosomes   are   visible.
When you do, you should see some   cells   arrested   during   mitosis   (Fig.   1).   Ensure   that   you   can   identify   the   stages of   mitosis seen. The four   main stages are   prophase,   metaphase,   anaphase,   and telophase.
Fig.   1   Cells of the   meristematic   region – cuboidal and   in   chains, with   some   arrested   during   mitosis
Q2.1    In   Figure   1,   label a cell at   each   of the   stages   of   mitosis.


Practical Task 2.2:   Mitotic   Index
One common variable we   measure   in dividing cells   is the   mitotic   index   of the   tissue. The   mitotic   index   refers   to   the   proportion   of   dividing   cells   within   the   tissue.   We   can   estimate   this   for   the   meristematic   region of the   root tip.
You will   need to observe three separate fields of   view   of   the   meristem   under   high   power   (x40).   Be   careful that there   is suf代 写AGRI10051 PRACTICAL 1: Chromosomes, Cell Replication and DNA 2024 Prac 1C/C++
代做程序编程语言ficient clearance   between the objective and   the   slide.   Count   the   total   number   of   cells   in   the   field of view   (only whole cells). Count the   number   of   cells   in   mitosis   (any   stage where   chromosomes   are condensed and visible). Then divide the cells   in   mitosis   by the total   number   of   cells   you   see.   This   is   an   estimate of the   mitotic   index.   Repeat this for each field of view   to   get   a   more   accurate   estimate.
Q2.2a.   Record your data   in the table   below and calculate   an   estimate   of the   mitotic   index for   this   tissue.

In the   lab you would   repeat this   10 times   using different fields   under   high   power to   get   a   more   accurate   estimate.
Q2.2b.   Using a   pie chart, show the   relationship   between the time   spent   at   interphase   compared to   mitosis.
Q2.2c.   Suppose the cell cycle for garlic   meristematic tissue   is   24   hours.   How   long would   a   cell   spend   in   mitosis each   day?
High   mitotic   rates are often   indicative of cancer, which   is   simply   uncontrolled   cell   growth. Therefore, mitotic   indices are   useful when observing cancer   pathology.   For some   cancers,   mitotic   indices   are   the   most   reliable   predictor of whether a cancer   will   reoccur.
Consider   the   data   below   on   meningiomas, which   are   tumours   arising   from   the   meninges   –   membranes surrounding   the   brain   and   spinal   cord.

<4, dashed   line denotes a   mitotic   index of 4   or   more. Adapted   from Kim et al.   2007
Q2.2d.   Describe the   relationship   between   mitotic   index and the   probability of survival as   shown   in   Fig.   2.
Q2.2e.   In the study above, an average   number   of   mitoses   in   10   high-power fields   of   view   was   calculated,   and   reported as a single   number,   rather than a   proportion.   Why   do you   think   this   repetition   is important   in cancer studies?
ACTIVITY   3:   DNA   EXTRACTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             20   MINSDeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) is found in the cells of   living   organisms,   and   encodes the   blueprint   instructions   for life. Extracting DNA    allows us to determine the genotype of individuals and   conduct   other   genetic   analyses.   We now know enough   about    how   to   extract    DNA   that   we can   even use common household   reagents to   do this,   even from your   own   cheek   cells.   Some   organisms   contain   more   DNA   in   their   cells   than   others, which   makes them   a good   choice for   some   bucket   biochemistry   DNA   extraction.   Fruits   in   particular   contain   lots   of   DNA, and   today   we   will   extract   DNA   from   strawberries.
To extract   DNA, we   need a   reagent to   perform. each   of the following   steps:
1.                   Rupture the cell   membrane with a   detergent.
2.                  Separate the   DNA from   its associated   proteins.
3.                   Precipitate the   DNA out of solution   using   alcohol.
Materials
•         Strawberry
•         Ziplock   bag
•          Lysis   buffer
•          Plastic   cup
•         Coffee   filter
•          Ethanol   (cold)
Method
1.            Remove   leaves from the top of a   strawberry.
2.          Place the   strawberry   in   a   Ziplock   bag   and   pulverise the   fruit   by   pressing down with your   hand or   rolling a   pen   back   and   forth over   it   (don’t   break the   bag!)
3.          Add   10   ml of   lysis   buffer.   (To   make   100   ml   of this   solution, we
mixed 90   ml of water with   10   ml of   shampoo   and   ¼ teaspoon   of   salt.)
4.          Mix   lysis   buffer with   the   fruit   by   pressing   down   on   the   Ziplock   bag or   rolling a   pen   back and   forth   over   it   for   2   minutes.
5.          Place   a   coffee filter   into   a   cup.   Pour   the   contents   of the   Ziplock   bag   into the coffee filter and set   aside   for   10   minutes.
6.          Discard the   coffee filter   and   its   contents.   Keep   the   liquid   in   the   cup   (the   filtrate).
7.          Pour   30   ml   of   cold   ethanol   into   a tube,   then   pour   in   the   filtrate.   The   DNA   should   become   visible   as   a   white   precipitate   at   this
stage!
8.          Take a glass   rod   and give   it   an   electrostatic   charge   it   by   rubbing   it on your shirt a few   times.   Spool   the   DNA   onto   the   rod.
Compare   your   extraction   with   the   others   on   your   bench.   Who precipitated the   most   DNA?
In a   research   lab, the   DNA extracted would   be cleaned   and   dried,   and then   resuspended   in   an   appropriate   solution   for   subsequent   use   and/or   storage.
Q3.1a.   How do you think a detergent   helps to   rupture the   cell   membrane?   Explain.
Q3.1b.   Deduce the function of the salt   in the extraction   process.   (i.e.   Why   not   use   plain   or   distilled   water?)
Q3.1c.   Consider the steps   required to extract   DNA   listed above.   How would you   modify   this   protocol   if   you   were   trying   to   extract   DNA   from   bacterial   cells   instead?
ACTIVITY   4: CHARACTERISING   AUXOTROPHS                                                                                                                                                                                                         20   MINS
Practical Task 4.1: Setting   up the experiment
Your average wildtype   bacterium can   produce all the   organic   compounds   it   requires, such   as   amino   acids   and vitamins, from   inorganic sources   in the environment. This type of   bacterium   is   known   as   a   prototroph.   Prototrophs can grow on   minimal   media agar, which   only   contains   inorganic   ingredients.
However,   if there   is a   block   in a   pathway to   manufacture one of   these   compounds,   the   bacteria   must   be   provided with the compound   in the environment and   will   not   grow   on   minimal   media   without   it. This strain of   bacterium   is   known as an auxotroph.   By   adding   different   compounds to   minimal   media   and seeing   which   compound   allows   bacteria   to   grow, we   can   establish   in   which   pathway   this   block   occurs.
In this activity, you will determine the supplement   requirements   of   4   strains   of   E.   coli   auxotrophs.   Because the   bacteria   need   to   time   to   grow, you   will   perform   the   set-up   for   this   experiment   this   week   and   analyse   the   results   in the   next   practical   in Week 3.
Work in groups of 4 – you will   need to   share your   results   so that   all   4   strains   can   be   analysed   between   you.
Equipment per group
•         4 agar   plate with   minimal   media
•         4   Eppendorf   tube   containing   bacterial   suspension   – each   student   in   group   to   choose   1   auxotroph strain   (A,   B, C   or   D)
•          Petri dishes with   paper tabs   labelled: Arg   (arginine),   Leu   (leucine),   Meth   (methionine), Tyr
(tyrosine),   Phe   (phenylalanine). These tabs   have   been soaked   in the corresponding compound.
•          Micropipette   and   tips
•         Sterile   spreader
•          Forceps
•         Alcohol
Procedure
When   working   with   the agar plates you   want to minimise   the exposure of the agar   to   air   and   other   contaminants like your hands.   Therefore, keep   the lid on   the plate   whenever possible.
1.       Collect the   Eppendorf tube containing the   strain   of   bacteria   that   you   will   work   with   (A,   B,   C,   or   D).
2.       Clearly   label around the edge   of   the   base   of   your   petri   dish   with   your   seat   number,   prac   day/time,   and   your   bacterial strain   (A,   B, C   or   D).
3.       Using a   micropipette   and tip,   transfer   100   µL   of   the   bacterial   strain   onto   the   surface   of   the   agar.
4.       Using the sterile   spreader,   spread   the   bacteria   over   the   surface   of the   agar   as   demonstrated   in   the   TechTip video.   Replace the   lid on the   petri dish.
5.       Sit the agar   petri dish   on   top   of   the   laminated   template   provided   on   your   bench   (see   Figure   3   below).
6.       Dip the forceps   into the   alcohol   and   carefully   shake   off   excess   alcohol.
7.       Using the   now dry   and sterile forceps,   pick   up   the   first   paper   tab   e.g.,   Arg,   and   without   touching      anything else,   lift the   lid of the   petri dish and   place   the   tab   on   the   surface   of   the   agar,   above   the   corresponding   position   of   the   template.   Lower   the   lid   of   the   dish.
8.       Dip the forceps   into the   alcohol   and   carefully   shake   off   excess   alcohol.   Repeat   step   7   until   each   paper   tab   is   in the correct   position as   per   Figure   3   below.
Do   NOT   invert   the   plates.   Leave   them   in   the   tray   for   incubating, with   the   tabs   facing   upwards. These   plates will   be   returned to you   in the   next   practical   (Week 3).
Each strain   has   been spread on   minimal   media. The   paper tabs that you   are   placing   on the   agar   plate   are   each   infused with a different amino acid.   The   amino   acids   in   the   paper   tabs   will   diffuse   out   into   the   agar.

Q4.1a.   Without   using   the   word   ‘control’, explain   why   one   paper   tab   is   infused   with   water   only.
Q4.1b.   If, when you check the   plates   next   practical, you were to observe   growth   of   E.   coli   around   the   disc   impregnated   with   water,   how   would   this   influence   the   conclusions   you   could   draw   from   your experiment?
